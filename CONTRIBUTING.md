# Contribution Guide
_**Note:** The guide for contributing to this repo is mostly based on the [contribution guide for Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) itself._

## Code of Conduct
Please read and follow our [Code of conduct](https://github.com/mobi/goponents/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Got a question, problem, or feedback?
Feel free to open up [an issue](https://github.com/mobi/goponents/issues/new/choose) using the appropriate template.

When any sort of issue is created, depending on the impact or urgency of the issue, one of our [contributors](https://github.com/mobi/goponents/graphs/contributors) will respond as quickly as appropriate on the issue itself. We will try to give a timeline and release schedule for any request that is made.

We would also welcome anyone to open up a [pull request]() for a bug or issue experienced in order to expedite the process.

## Feature requests
You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mobi/goponents/issues). If you would like to _implement_ a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work first. 

Our team will first make sure of the following: 
1. That we can use it. 
2. Where it fits into our current road map. 
3. What design resources and support will be needed before the feature work can begin. 

Please consider what kind of change it is:

For a **Major Feature**, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.

**Small Features** can be crafted and directly submitted as a Pull Request so long as they have the appropriate design support.
